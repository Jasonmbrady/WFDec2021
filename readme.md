Hello Ninjas! 

This repository is a place for you to review the code of any exercises or demos that we may have done in class. You can find each individual project in the folder corresponding to the specific week that the demo was done.

I will try to add comments to make the code a little clearer and easier to read. Please feel free to use this as a reminder, and to aid when you are working on your own assignments or exam. However, please do NOT copy-paste my code directly into your project or exam. Working out how to implement code on your own is one of the most important skills you will gain in your time here, and you are only selling yourself short if you just copy code rather than trying to understand it. Additionally, plagiarism is against our Academic Honesty policy, which we take VERY seriously. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the code or projects you find in here! Happy Coding!
